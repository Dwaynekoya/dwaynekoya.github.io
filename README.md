This is a webpage I built during my first year of Formaci√≥n Profesional (think something similar to vocational training!). It's a template for a personal portfolio as well as a template for a tabletop roleplaying game based on Cyberpunk 2020.
These would be 2 separate webpages but share the same repository because of schoolwork reasons :P
